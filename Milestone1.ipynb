This would have helped us with clearing up questions about how certain parts of the assignment was to be interpreted, as well as continued errors we couldn’t fix.  \n",

But there were just too many different tutorials and it was unclear e.g. which image is needed now or what do we have to change in the pangram example image. So there isn’t enough time in the end to ask those questions, so we would have needed another Q&A session. Also many problems were build around different interpretations of the tasks, so what is really asked from us for the first milestone and what we should upload to Tira (e.g just the notebook or the notebook and the python code, ...)."

Furthermore, I found the various guidelines to a certain degree helpful for getting started but quite quickly became confused about how to actually upload our work and what should be entailed in it. A clear instruction and goal as well as showing the steps in the course and explaining obstacles not only for Linux-based operating systems would be helpful and appreciated."

It essentially just said to use the `pangrams.py` file as a template, but I think some comments in the code would have been helpful for that. I have to admit that I was on the brink of dropping out of the module entirely when I could still not get it to work by Monday night.\n",
